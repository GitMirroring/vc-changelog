## This file specifies the files and directories that can usually occur in a
## developer build of this Git repository.
##
## Reference: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
##
## When we say, "files", it actually means files and directories. By
## convention, directories are marked through a trailing first and listed
## first in each category.
##
## We don't list files that may occur in exceptional situations (such as
## temporary files *.h-t), because a developer should notice when such a
## file is not erased by "make mostlyclean".
