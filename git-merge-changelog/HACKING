All you need to know when hacking (modifying) GNU git-merge-changelog or when
building it off a git checkout.


Requirements
============

You will need reasonably recent versions of the build tools:

  * A C compiler. Such as GNU GCC.
    + Homepage:
      https://gcc.gnu.org/

  * GNU automake 1.16.4 or newer
    + Homepage:
      https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/

  * GNU autoconf
    + Homepage:
      https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

  * GNU m4
    + Homepage:
      https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/

  * GNU sed
    + Homepage:
      https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/

  * Perl
    + Homepage:
      https://www.perl.org/

  * Either an internet connection or a recent copy of GNU gnulib.
    In order to work with the HEAD of git-merge-changelog development, you need
    the HEAD of the gnulib development.
    In order to work with the version of git-merge-changelog at a given date,
    you need the version of gnulib of the same date.
    In order to work with a released tarball of git-merge-changelog, you need
    the particular version of gnulib which is indicated in the GNULIB_GIT_COMMIT
    variable in version.sh.
    + Homepage:
      https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/

And, of course, the packages listed in the DEPENDENCIES file.


Building off the Git repository
===============================

Access to the Git repository is described at
https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=vc-changelog .

After fetching the sources from the Git repository, peek at the comments in
autogen.sh, then run
  ./autopull.sh
  ./autogen.sh
Then you can proceed with "./configure" as usual.

Each time you want to update the source, do not only "git pull".  Instead do
  git pull && ./autopull.sh
  ./autogen.sh
